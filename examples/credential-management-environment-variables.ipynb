    "Using environment variables is a fast way to access credentials from within a notebook without storing the credentials inside of the notebook code. Using this method prevents you from hard coding credentials directly in your code and avoids an accidental exposure to your repository via version control; the environment variables are most likely stored in plain text on your local development environment.\n",
